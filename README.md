# Requirements
Make sure that you have the following installed:
- [node](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-node-js-on-ubuntu-18-04) 
- npm 
- [MongoDB](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-ubuntu/) and start the mongodb service with `sudo service mongod start`

## Navigate to the Client Folder 
 `cd client`

## Run the folllowing command to install the dependencies 
 `npm install`

## Run the folllowing to start the app
 `npm start`

## Open a new terminal and run the same commands in the backend folder
 `cd ../backend`

 `npm install`

 `npm start`

## About the app
Actually, there are two separated apps. The Client which serves the FrontEnd (using React), and the Backend (in Node/Express).

Run the app using :

`$ docker-compose up --build`
The MERN stack is becoming increasingly popular and could be a powerful stack to figure in. Therefore having the ability to build ****and deploy good MERN applications, greatly helps career prospects as a developer.

The App should be App :
## What is the MERN Stack?

visit client : http://localhost:3000
The MERN stack is a JavaScript stack that is designed to make the development process smoother. MERN includes four open-source components: MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js. These components offer an associate ****end-to-end framework for developers to work in.

visit server : http://localhost:5000
## A Closer Look at MERN Stack Components

To check the status :
### MongoDB: A cross-platform document database

`docker-compose ps`
[MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) is a NoSQL (non-relational) document-oriented database. Data is stored in flexible documents with a JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)-based query language. MongoDB is known for being flexible and easy to scale.

### How to stop the App :
### Express: A back-end web application framework

`$ docker-compose stop`
[Express](https://expressjs.com/) is a web application framework for Node.js, another MERN component. Instead of writing full web server code by hand on Node.js directly, developers use Express to simplify the task of writing server code.

## Languages & tools
### React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces

- [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/)
[React](https://reactjs.org/) was originally created by a software engineer at Facebook, and was later open-sourced. The React library can be used for creating views rendered in HTML. In a way, itâ€™s the defining feature of the stack.

- [Express](https://expressjs.com/)
### Node.js: A cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment
